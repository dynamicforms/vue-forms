# Gaps

Open questions about the library — things not yet decided, as opposed to decisions already made and their
reasoning, which belong in `DECISIONS.md`. An entry here is closed by making the decision: it moves to
`DECISIONS.md` as a normal entry, and is deleted from this file rather than marked resolved.

## `X` does not reach a validator's or an action's own callback

A validator's callback receives its field typed `FieldBase<T>`, so reading `field.extra` inside one answers
`Readonly<{}>` and needs a cast; the same is true of `FieldActionExecute`. The element a rule is registered on
carries the full `FieldBase<T, X>` type — the gap is only in what the callback signatures themselves state.

Threading `X` through both would reach every action class and every signature that takes an element as a
parameter, which is a wider change than adding the type argument to `FieldBase` was (`DECISIONS.md`, "Extended
properties live in one tracked slot..."). Undecided whether that is worth doing, and if so, whether `X` defaults
to `{}` on those signatures the way it does everywhere else or is required to be stated explicitly.
